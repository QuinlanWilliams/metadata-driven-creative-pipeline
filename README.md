# Asset Pipeline Automation Framework (Portfolio Edition)

**Version:** 1.0.0-public  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19

This is a portfolio-safe, public demonstration of a metadata-driven asset pipeline system.

The framework models how a creative production team can:
- Standardize intake and shot planning
- Automate metadata generation
- Eliminate manual entry during asset processing
- Improve downstream searchability and consistency

## System Overview

The framework is built around a metadata-first architecture:

1. Stories (content batches) are defined
2. SKUs are mapped to required shots
3. Metadata outputs are auto-generated:
   - Filename prefix
   - Title
   - Description
   - Keywords
4. Outputs feed into Lightroom → DAM → Ecommerce
